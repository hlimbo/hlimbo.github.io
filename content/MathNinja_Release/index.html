  <h1>About Game:</h1>
  <p>
    MathNinja is an educational game catered towards elementary schoolers
    who have trouble memorizing their multiplication tables. I was inspired
    to create this game from my little brother who had trouble memorizing his
    multiplication tables. If you are tired of flipping through boring old
    flash cards in hopes of memorizing your multiplication tables, then this
    game is for you!
